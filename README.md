# SeaOfThieves-FixLavenderBeard
I got tired of having to do this every time I came back to play SoT. So I wrote a program to do it for me. :D

## *FOR STEAM USERS ONLY!*

Requirements: Needs .NET 8 Runtime installed.

From the official [Sea of Thieves support page](https://support.seaofthieves.com/articles/360000792028), this program specifically automates the following suggested fix:
> For Steam - If you are being prevented access to Sea of Thieves due to the Lavenderbeard error when using the Steam version, please try the following actions:

> Clear Xbox Live credential from Steam
> - Click the Start button from the bottom Left corner of Windows and type Credential Manager then press Enter.
> - Once viewing the Credentials Manager, click the Windows Credentials button.
> - Find Entries labelled Xbl_Ticket
> - Left click any with 1717113201 (or 804980065 if you are playing the Insiders Build) in the name and select Remove
> - Sign back in to Sea of Thieves
